Make the most of your time at the International Open Data Conferencehttp://www.civio.es/en/ in Madrid by joining us [the Fundación Civio, a Spanish non-for-profit civic technology organization with the mission to improve government transparency and accountability] and other #IODC participants for pre-event drinks to be held on Wednesday October 5 from 19:30pm – 21:30pm at The Hat, an amazing rooftop bar over looking the city centre, right by Plaza Mayor. 
 
We shall relax with a drink, meet up with old friends, make some new and raise a glass to a good conference.
